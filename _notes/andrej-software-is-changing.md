## Three Paradigms of Software

| Era | What you program | ~When |
|---|---|---|
| Software 1.0 | Explicit code — logic written by humans | ~1940s |
| Software 2.0 | Weights of a neural network | ~2019 |
| Software 3.0 | LLMs via prompts — natural language as code | ~2023 |

In Software 3.0, the program *is* the prompt. Writing instructions in plain English is now a legitimate way to program a computer.

## How to Think About LLMs — The OS Analogy

The closest analogy for an LLM is an **operating system**:

- **Closed source** — GPT (Microsoft/OpenAI), Gemini (Google), Claude (Anthropic)
- **Open source** — LLaMA is the Linux equivalent

And just like with operating systems, it's not only about the kernel (the model). The real story is the **ecosystem** — tools, modalities, integrations, and the platform that builds up around it.
